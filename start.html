    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language
      for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
      structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
      the appearance of the document.</p>

        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
        images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded
        into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
        lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags,
        written using angle brackets. </p>
